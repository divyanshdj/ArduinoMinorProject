# Automatic Room Appliances Controller Using Arduino and PIR Sensor

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an automated system that controls room appliances (like lights and fans) based on human presence using an Arduino microcontroller and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The PIR sensor detects motion, and the Arduino processes this data to switch appliances on or off, thereby improving energy efficiency and convenience.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methods of manually controlling room appliances often lead to energy wastage. This project aims to develop an automatic system that manages appliances based on occupancy, ensuring they are only active when needed.

## Objective
- Design a system to control appliances based on human presence.
- Enhance energy efficiency and user convenience.

## Scope
- Suitable for homes, offices, and other indoor environments.
- Can be expanded to include more sensors and appliances.

## Methodology
1. **Research and Planning:** Study PIR sensors and Arduino, design the circuit.
2. **Component Procurement:** Gather Arduino, PIR sensor, relays, and other necessary components.
3. **Circuit Design:** Connect PIR sensor to Arduino and relay module.
4. **Programming:** Write and upload code to Arduino to control appliances.
5. **Assembly and Testing:** Assemble components, test system functionality, and refine.
6. **Deployment:** Install system in a test environment, monitor performance, and adjust as needed.
